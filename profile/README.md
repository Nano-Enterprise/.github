## ‚ùì What is Nano Enterprise?

**Nano Enterprise** is a Mac-native business hub that brings **CRM, invoicing, inventory, expenses, and simple project tracking** together in one fast desktop app. It‚Äôs designed for solo founders and small teams who don‚Äôt want a heavy ERP or monthly subscriptions just to send professional invoices, track stock, and keep customer notes in one place.

The workflow is streamlined: capture a lead, convert it to a customer, generate a quote, turn that quote into an invoice, take payment, and watch inventory levels and cash flow update automatically. Smart lists, tags, and saved filters keep growing databases tidy. Built-in templates let you brand documents with your logo, colors, and legal notes‚Äîno external design tools required.

Under the hood, Nano Enterprise stores clean, portable data and exports to **PDF/CSV** for sharing with clients and accountants. You can add attachments (photos of receipts, contracts, POs), track taxes and discounts, and schedule reminders for unpaid invoices. A dashboard highlights overdue items, low-stock products, revenue trends, and upcoming tasks so you always know what deserves attention.
